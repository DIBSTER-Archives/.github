# üòÉ Information:

‚û£ This organization contains projects and code I no longer want to keep on my main GitHub profile, and just want some place random to toss it. Most of this code is outdated from projects I no longer have interests in, or are too old to be considered worthy of close source. Located below are a list of repositories that I've made public.

‚û£ You can contact me at: `hello@dibster-is-a.engineer`, my Discord `DIBSTER#2317`, or my Twitter `@DEV_DIBSTER`.

‚û£ If you want to view my main profile, you can find it here: [DEV-DIBSTER](https://github.com/DEV-DIBSTER).

# üìú Projects:

- [File Renamer](https://github.com/DIBSTER-Archives/Files-In-Folder-Renamer)
  - This project was a simple way to rename files in a folder with UUIDs to easily store in a CDN.

- [Welcome Bot](https://github.com/DIBSTER-Archives/Welcome-Bot)
  - First ever open source bot I did, was just to prove you can build a bot for simple uses.

- [LS Music Bot](https://github.com/DIBSTER-Archives/LS-Music-Bot)
  - This was a bot I modified to use for LS Gaming. It was around the peak of 2020-2021.

- [Pterodactyl Bot](https://github.com/DIBSTER-Archives/Public-Pterodactyl-Discord-Bot)
  - This was an unfinished Discord Bot that would be used in a host like server. Never finished as DiscordJS V13 became obsolete.
 
- [Colette Bot](https://github.com/DIBSTER-Archives/Colette-Bot)
  - My first working Discord Stats Bot. Used to get analytics from Brawl Stars and Brawlify API. Thanks to Bimi and Dest for helping me with it.
