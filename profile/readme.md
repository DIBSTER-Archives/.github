# Projects:

- [File Renamer](https://github.com/DIBSTER-Archives/Files-In-Folder-Renamer)
  - This project was a simple way to rename files in a folder with UUIDs to easily store in a CDN.

- [Welcome Bot](https://github.com/DIBSTER-Archives/Welcome-Bot)
  - First ever open source bot I did, was just to prove you can build a bot for simple uses.

- [LS Music Bot](https://github.com/DIBSTER-Archives/LS-Music-Bot)
  - This was a bot I modified to use for LS Gaming. It was around the peak of 2020-2021.

- [Pterodactyl Bot](https://github.com/DIBSTER-Archives/Public-Pterodactyl-Discord-Bot)
  - This was an unfinished Discord Bot that would be used in a host like server. Never finished as DiscordJS V13 became obsolete.
